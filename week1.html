        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
          The first week at Quantum Weave was primarily an introduction and
          onboarding process to understand the WIL Project and the company. I
          participated in activities to get to know the team, understand the
          culture, and start building a communication plan. I also learned about
          the "LiveMesh" system, an innovative technology for task distribution
          between devices and the cloud, which is the core of the company’s
          product.
        </p>

        <h2>So What?</h2>
        <p>
          This week made me realize the importance of quickly adapting to a real
          professional environment beyond technical skills, focusing also on
          soft skills like communication and teamwork. Understanding Quantum
          Weave’s context and vision motivated me to appreciate
          interdisciplinarity and innovation, which are crucial for a full stack
          developer collaborating with different specialists.
        </p>

        <h2>Now What?</h2>
        <p>
          For next week, I will focus on applying what I learned about effective
          communication to coordinate with my team. I will work on establishing
          a clear plan to share information, avoid misunderstandings, and foster
          collaboration. I will also prepare my technical skills to confidently
          tackle project tasks, maintaining an open attitude toward learning and
          feedback.
