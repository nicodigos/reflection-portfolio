        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
          This week, I explored an open-source GitHub repository and made a
          beginner-level contribution. I selected a project with clear
          contribution guidelines and picked an issue labeled “good first
          issue.” After forking and cloning the repository, I reviewed the
          codebase, made a small but useful change, and opened a pull request
          with clear documentation.
        </p>

        <h2>So What?</h2>
        <p>
          Contributing to an existing project helped me understand that open
          source isn’t just about writing code—it’s about respecting the systems
          others have built. By reading someone else’s code, I learned how
          important clarity and structure are in collaborative environments. It
          also reminded me that helpful documentation and clean communication
          make a big difference for maintainers and future contributors.
        </p>

        <h2>Now What?</h2>
        <p>
          Moving forward, I’ll continue exploring open-source projects as a way
          to grow and contribute meaningfully to the developer community. I’ll
          ensure my contributions are respectful, well-documented, and easy to
          understand. This experience has motivated me to approach codebases
          with more care and to always communicate clearly through pull requests
          and commit messages.
        </p>
