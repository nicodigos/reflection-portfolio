        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
          This week’s challenge was to design a real-time resource monitoring
          system for LiveMesh. The system needed to collect performance data
          from edge devices and cloud services, process it centrally, and
          display live analytics through a browser-based dashboard. Rather than
          building it directly, our task was to break down the system into
          layers and choose an appropriate full stack — from front-end to
          back-end and database — with clear justifications.
        </p>

        <h2>So What?</h2>
        <p>
          This experience taught me that technology selection is not just about
          preference or popularity — it’s about resilience, scalability, and fit
          for purpose. Real-time systems must handle unpredictable traffic,
          integrate with dynamic environments, and ensure low-latency data
          flows. Choosing tools like WebSockets for communication, Kafka for
          queuing, and a NoSQL database for flexible storage revealed how
          architectural decisions influence the overall success of a system. It
          also sharpened my ability to think in systems, not just code.
        </p>

        <h2>Now What?</h2>
        <p>
          Moving forward, I will prioritize understanding system requirements
          before jumping into code. I aim to become more intentional in stack
          selection, considering factors like performance under load, failure
          recovery, and long-term maintainability. I’ll also explore
          technologies like Redis, container orchestration, and scalable
          front-end frameworks like React with hooks for real-time updates.
          Designing before building is not wasted time — it’s what makes complex
          systems possible.
