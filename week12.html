        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
          This week, I focused on building a professional portfolio website that
          represents me as a developer. The project required me to include a
          brief introduction, showcase at least one project, and implement a
          contact form with proper validation and visual feedback. The site was
          built with responsiveness in mind to work smoothly across devices.
          Once complete, I deployed it online to be accessible by potential
          clients or employers.
        </p>

        <h2>So What?</h2>
        <p>
          This task shifted my focus from just building backend or frontend
          systems to thinking about how to present myself as a developer. It
          made me consider how users (especially clients or hiring managers)
          experience a developer’s work through layout, clarity, and
          accessibility. The emphasis on a clean design and an easy-to-use
          contact form reminded me that professionalism extends beyond code
          quality — it includes how clearly we communicate our value.
        </p>

        <h2>Now What?</h2>
        <p>
          Moving forward, I’ll be more intentional about how I present my work.
          I’ll refine my portfolio regularly, update it with new projects, and
          ensure it always includes a clear way for others to reach me. This
          experience reminded me that technical skills are only one part of the
          equation — the ability to represent those skills clearly and
          confidently is just as important, especially in a freelance or
          job-seeking context.
        </p>
