        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
          This week, the focus shifted to designing and querying relational
          databases with discipline. Our challenge was to define a small set of
          related tables for a fictional application, ensuring proper use of
          primary and foreign keys. We also had to write secure CRUD operations
          in SQL — a Create, a Read, and an Update or Delete query — each with
          clarity and intent.
        </p>

        <h2>So What?</h2>
        <p>
          This task helped me appreciate the importance of structure and
          foresight in database design. Seeing data relationships visualized in
          real time emphasized how careless logic or bloated queries can degrade
          both performance and security. Good databases aren’t just about
          storing data — they’re about managing it responsibly, anticipating
          future maintenance and scalability.
        </p>

        <h2>Now What?</h2>
        <p>
          I plan to deepen my SQL skills by practicing more complex queries and
          studying indexing and normalization strategies. I also want to focus
          on writing queries that are efficient, safe from injection attacks,
          and easy for others to understand. My goal is to treat every database
          interaction as a shared responsibility, not just a technical task.
