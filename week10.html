        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
          This week focused on translating logical schemas into robust,
          normalized SQL table definitions. The assignment emphasized relational
          database design using enterprise-level DBMS tools. The task required
          the creation of at least 3-4 interrelated tables, each with primary
          keys, relevant fields and data types, and at least one foreign key
          relationship.
        </p>

        <h2>So What?</h2>
        <p>
          This exercise highlighted the importance of thoughtful database design
          in building reliable backend systems. Mira's challenge emphasized that
          schemas are more than structural blueprints—they are promises to
          uphold data integrity, consistency, and scalability. Understanding how
          constraints, normalization, and foreign keys interact helped clarify
          how poor design decisions can ripple through an application.
        </p>

        <h2>Now What?</h2>
        <p>
          Going forward, I will prioritize schema clarity and normalization in
          any backend system I design. I aim to write SQL with precision, using
          foreign keys and constraints to safeguard data integrity. Future
          contributions will include well-documented schema decisions to make
          collaborative development and future scaling more seamless. This week
          reinforced the idea that a good schema is the foundation of
          trustworthy data systems.
