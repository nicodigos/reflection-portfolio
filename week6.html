        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
          This week’s challenge was to address the chaotic state of Git
          practices at Quantum Weave. A recent pull request had caused
          unexpected behavior, not because of flawed logic, but due to an
          unstructured merge process. Our goal was to build a clean, visual
          one-page Git guide for onboarding new developers — covering branch
          naming conventions, commit structures, pull request protocols, and a
          sample workflow.
        </p>

        <h2>So What?</h2>
        <p>
          This experience highlighted the importance of good collaboration
          practices in software development. Git isn't just a versioning tool —
          it’s a communication system. Without clear branches, descriptive
          commits, and reviewed pull requests, even the best code can lead to
          disaster. This task reminded me that writing code is a team effort,
          and that consistency and clarity are key to scaling development.
        </p>

        <h2>Now What?</h2>
        <p>
          Moving forward, I plan to reinforce structured Git workflows in all
          team projects. I’ll advocate for better habits like atomic commits,
          thoughtful naming, and regular code reviews. I also aim to keep
          improving my documentation and onboarding skills, so that other
          developers can integrate smoothly and avoid past mistakes. Git
          discipline isn’t optional — it’s the foundation of sustainable
          teamwork.
