        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
          This week’s challenge was to create a simple interactive game aimed at
          children aged 8 to 12, using Scratch or a similar low-code tool. The
          game needed player interaction via keyboard or mouse, a clear
          objective such as scoring or a time limit, and visual feedback
          including animations and game-over screens. The goal was to build
          something both fun and logically clean, with pseudocode outlining its
          core game mechanics.
        </p>

        <h2>So What?</h2>
        <p>
          This project emphasized how programming logic can be accessible and
          engaging, even in low-code environments. Designing for kids required
          clear triggers, game states, and input-response flows that are easy to
          follow and maintain. It reinforced the value of breaking down program
          logic into simple, understandable steps, making the code approachable
          for junior developers and learners. Games aren’t just entertainment —
          they are a practical way to practice logic and structure.
        </p>

        <h2>Now What?</h2>
        <p>
          Moving forward, I plan to continue exploring how to communicate
          complex logic through simple constructs and visual tools. I want to
          develop more educational games and prototypes that teach programming
          fundamentals through play. Writing clear pseudocode before
          implementation will remain a key practice, ensuring any developer can
          pick up and extend my projects. This week reminded me that clarity in
          logic is as important as creativity in design.
