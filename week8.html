        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
          This week’s challenge was to guide a new intern on the LiveMesh
          interface team through the world of software architecture. With no
          prior experience in distributed systems, our task was to create a
          clear, developer-friendly comparison of four major architectural
          patterns: monolith, modular monolith, microservices, and serverless.
          Each needed a definition, pros and cons, a visual diagram, and
          guidance on when to use each — all from a mentor's perspective.
        </p>

        <h2>So What?</h2>
        <p>
          This case study reminded me that good developers must also be good
          teachers. It’s not enough to know which architecture to choose — we
          must be able to explain why. Each pattern has its place: monoliths
          offer simplicity, microservices scale independently, modular monoliths
          balance complexity and structure, and serverless can reduce overhead
          for event-driven apps. Learning to break down these concepts in an
          accessible way sharpened both my own understanding and my
          communication skills.
        </p>

        <h2>Now What?</h2>
        <p>
          Moving forward, I want to be more intentional about architectural
          decisions in my own projects, and be ready to explain them clearly to
          others. Whether I'm mentoring a junior developer or making a technical
          pitch, I’ll carry forward this approach: define, compare, visualize,
          and contextualize. I also plan to expand my knowledge of hybrid
          patterns and architectural trade-offs in real-world deployments —
          because when systems grow, structure matters.
